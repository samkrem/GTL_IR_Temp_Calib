# MIT Gas Turbine Lab Infared Temperature Sensor Calibration and Experiment 
Conducted series of experiments and calibrations on the effect of varying ambient temperature on infared temperature sensor output
## Main Objective: Calibrating a Raytek MI3-M infared temperature sensor for analysis of an electrified 1 megawatt motor generator.
## Primary contributions: 
* Connected the sensor hardware to the data acquisition system 
* Created program to calibrate, collect, and graphically display the temperature data.
